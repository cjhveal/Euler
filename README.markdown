EULER
=====
an experiment in haskell
------------------------

This is my attempt to become more literate in both mathematics and haskell.
I will be attempting to solve as many problems from <a href="http://www.projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> as I can.

I have started this project with no prior knowledge of haskell. I have experience with c(++), java, scheme, perl, ruby-- and with this project I would like to add haskell.
